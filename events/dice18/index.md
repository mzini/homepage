# <a name="introduction"/> Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity
## Thessaloniki, Greece - April 14-15, 2018 - part of ETAPS 2018


### <a name="context"/> Context
[DICE](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrick.baillot/DICE/) is a thematic workshop in the field of *Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC)*, where researchers in the area can meet and discuss their most recent results.
It takes place anually as part of [ETAPS](https://www.etaps.org/).


### <a name="topics"/> Scope and Topics

The area of *Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC)* has grown from several proposals for using logic and formal methods to provide languages for complexity-bounded computation (e.g. PTIME, LOGSPACE computation). Its aim is to study computational complexity without reference to external measuring conditions or particular machine models, but only in terms of language restrictions or logical/computational principles implying complexity properties.
This workshop focuses on ICC methods related to programs (rather than
descriptive methods). In this approach one relates complexity classes
to restrictions on programming paradigms (functional programs, lambda
calculi, rewriting systems), such as ramified recurrence, weak
polymorphic types, linear logic and linear types, and interpretative
measures. The two main objectives of this area are:

* to find natural implicit characterizations of various complexity
  classes of functions, thereby illuminating their nature and
  importance;
* to design methods suitable for static verification of program
  complexity.

Therefore ICC connects both to the  study of complexity classes and to
static program  analysis, in  particular, resource analysis.  With the
aim to more closely bring  together researches from these fields, this
year contributions related to program's resource analysis are strongly
encouraged.

The workshop is open to contributions on
various aspects of ICC and resource analysis, including (but not
exclusively):

* type systems for controlling/inferring/checking complexity;
* logical and machine-independent characterisations of complexity
  classes;
* programming languages for complexity-bounded computation;
* logics closely related to complexity classes;
* theoretical foundations of program complexity analysis;
* static resource analysis and practical applications;
* semantics of complexity-bounded computation;
* applications of implicit complexity to security;
* termination and resource analysis for probabilistic programs;
* semantic methods to analyse resources.

### <a name="venue"/> Venue

The workshop will be held in [Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki), Greece, on April 14-15, 2018, see also the corresponding [ETAPS page](https://www.etaps.org/index.php/2018/venue).

Thessaloniki is a Greek port city on the Thermaic Gulf of the Aegean Sea. It was among the biggest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire and is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments.
Thessaloniki features a mild climate, with [average temperatures](https://weatherspark.com/m/148497/4/Average-Weather-in-April-at-Thessaloniki-Airport-Greece) almost 20 degree in the second week of April.

# <a name="introduction"/> Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity
## Thessaloniki, Greece - April 14-15, 2018 - part of ETAPS 2018


### <a name="context"/> Context
[DICE](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrick.baillot/DICE/) is a thematic workshop in the field of *Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC)*, where researchers in the area can meet and discuss their most recent results.
It takes place anually as part of [ETAPS](https://www.etaps.org/).

### <a name="topics"/> Scope and Topics

The area of *Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC)* has grown from several proposals for using logic and formal methods to provide languages for complexity-bounded computation (e.g. PTIME, LOGSPACE computation). Its aim is to study computational complexity without reference to external measuring conditions or particular machine models, but only in terms of language restrictions or logical/computational principles implying complexity properties.

This workshop focuses on ICC methods related to programs. Traditionally, in this approach one relates complexity classes to restrictions on programming paradigms (functional programs, lambda calculi, rewriting systems), such as ramified recurrence, weak polymorphic types, linear logic and linear types, and interpretative measures.

<!-- The workshop will be open to contributions on various aspects of ICC including (but not exclusively):

### <a name="venue"/> Venue

The workshop will be held in [Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki), Greece, on April 14-15, 2018, see also the corresponding [ETAPS page](https://www.etaps.org/index.php/2018/venue).

Thessaloniki is a Greek port city on the Thermaic Gulf of the Aegean Sea. It was among the biggest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire and is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments.
Thessaloniki features a mild climate, with [average temperatures](https://weatherspark.com/m/148497/4/Average-Weather-in-April-at-Thessaloniki-Airport-Greece) almost 20 degree in the second week of April.

### <a name="submission"/> Submission

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract of up to **5 pages by 31 January, 2018** to the DICE 2018 EasyChair page.
Abstracts must be written in English and be submitted as a single PDF file.
Submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, interest and clarity.
Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop.
Abstract can contain material already published elsewhere before the workshop.
Preference will be given to abstracts containing novel work (including work in progress).
The workshop will not have formal proceedings and is not intended to preclude later publication at another venue.

Submissions of abstracts by PC members are allowed and encouraged.

Cichon and Weiermann introduced the notion of 
term rewriting characterizations, a 
rewriting theoretic framework which allows the
application of techniques from the field of rewriting in the study 
of recursive function theory. 
In this report we introduce the reader to 
the topic by reflecting the results and reasoning 
carried out in two papers by Isabelle Oitavem, leading to 
a characterization of PSPACE, the functions computable in polynomial space. 
%
We present a rewrite system R that naturally
models the functions in PSPACE. It is shown 
that every R reduction strategy yields an algorithm
that runs in polynomial space. Therefore 
R exactly describes the functions in PSPACE.

In this paper we present a new path order for rewrite
systems, the  *exponential path order* EPO\*.   Suppose a term
rewrite  system   is  compatible  with  EPO\*,   then  the  runtime
complexity  of  this  rewrite  system  is bounded  from  above  by  an
exponential function.  Furthermore, the  class of function computed by
a  rewrite  system  compatible  with  EPO\* equals  the  class  of
functions computable in exponential time on a Turing machine.

In this paper we introduce a restrictive version of the multiset path order, 
called *polynomial path order*. This recursive path order 
induces polynomial bounds on the maximal number of innermost rewrite steps.
This result opens the way to automatically verify for a given program, 
written  in an eager functional programming language, 
that the maximal number of evaluation steps starting from any function call is polynomial 
in the input size.
To test the feasibility of our approach we have implemented 
this technique and compare its applicability to existing methods.

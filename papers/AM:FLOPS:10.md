Recently, many techniques have been introduced
that allow the (automated) classification of 
the runtime complexity 
of term rewrite systems (TRSs for short).
In this paper we show that polynomial 
(innermost) runtime complexity of TRSs induces 
polytime computability of the functions defined.
In this way we show a tight correspondence between
the number of steps performed in a given rewrite
system and the computational complexity of an
implementation of rewriting.
The result uses graph rewriting as a first
step towards the implementation of term rewriting.
In particular, we prove the adequacy of 
(innermost) graph rewriting for (innermost) 
term rewriting.

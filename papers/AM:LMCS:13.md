This paper is concerned with the complexity analysis of
constructor term rewrite systems and its ramification in implicit
computational complexity.
We introduce a path order with multiset status, 
the *polynomial path order* POP\*, that is applicable
in two related, but distinct contexts.
On the one hand POP\* induces polynomial innermost runtime complexity
and hence may serve as a syntactic, and fully automatable, method to analyse
the innermost runtime complexity of term rewrite systems.
On the other hand POP\* provides an order-theoretic 
characterisation of the polytime computable functions: 
the polytime computable functions are exactly the functions
computable by an orthogonal constructor TRS compatible with POP\*.

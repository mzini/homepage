In earlier work, we have shown
that for confluent term rewrite systems (TRSs for short), innermost polynomial runtime complexity
induces polytime computability of the functions defined.
In this paper, we generalise this result to full rewriting, for that
we exploit graph rewriting. We give a new proof of the adequacy of 
graph rewriting for full rewriting that allows for
a precise control of the resources copied. In sum we
completely describe an implementation of rewriting
on a Turing machine (TM for short). We show that the runtime complexity of
the TRS and the runtime complexity of the TM is polynomially
related.

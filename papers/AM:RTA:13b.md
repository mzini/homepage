The *Tyrolean Complexity Tool*, [TCT](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/tct) for short,
is an open source complexity analyser for term rewrite systems.
Our tool TCT features a majority of the known techniques for the automated
characterisation of polynomial complexity of rewrite systems
and can investigate derivational and 
runtime complexity, for full and innermost rewriting. 
This system description outlines features and provides a short introduction to the usage of TCT.

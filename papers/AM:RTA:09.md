We show how *polynomial path orders* can be employed efficiently in 
conjunction with *weak innermost dependency pairs* to automatically certify the
polynomial runtime complexity of term rewrite systems and
the polytime computability of those functions computed by these
rewrite systems.
The established techniques have been implemented and we provide ample
experimental data to assess the new method.

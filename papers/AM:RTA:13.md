In this paper we present a combination framework for the automated
polynomial complexity analysis of term rewrite systems. The framework
covers both *derivational* and *runtime complexity* analysis, 
and is employed as theoretical foundation in the automated complexity tool
[TCT](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/tct).
We present generalisations of powerful complexity techniques, 
notably a generalisation of *complexity pairs* and *(weak) dependency pairs*. 
Finally, we also present a novel technique, called *dependency graph decomposition*, 
that in the dependency pair setting greatly increases modularity.

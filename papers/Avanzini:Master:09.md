The automated complexity analysis of rewrite systems is a challenging topic that
has recently gained much attention. As one practical application, techniques
developed for the analysis of rewrite systems can in principle be employed for
the automated analysis of functional programs. In this thesis, we present the
*polynomial path order*, a syntactic restriction of the well known multi-set path order.
The order is carefully crafted to induce polynomial bounds on
the runtime-complexity of compatible rewrite systems. Semantic labeling and
the dependency pair method are two prominent transformation techniques developed
in the context of termination analysis. Both significantly strengthen
the power of basic termination techniques. We show that suitable adaptations
as proposed in the literature can be employed together with the polynomial path order
for a complexity analysis. This severely widens the applicability of the polynomial path
order. Furthermore, we give an efficient automation that works by a reduction
to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Experimental results confirm the
feasibility of our approach.

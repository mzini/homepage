  We study how the adoption of an evaluation mechanism with sharing
  and memoization impacts the class of functions which can be computed
  in polynomial time. We first show how a natural cost model in
  which lookup for an already computed result has no cost is indeed
  invariant. As a corollary, we then prove that the most general
  notion of ramified recurrence is sound for polynomial time, this
  way settling an open problem in implicit computational complexity.

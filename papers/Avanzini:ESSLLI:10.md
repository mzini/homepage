The *polynomial path order* is 
a termination method that induces polynomial bounds on the 
innermost runtime complexity of term rewrite systems.
*Semantic labeling* is a transformation technique used for proving termination.

In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of polynomial path orders together with
*finite semantic labeling*. This automation works by a reduction to the problem of 
*boolean satisfiability*. 
We have implemented the technique and experimental results confirm the feasibility of our approach.
By semantic labeling the analytical power of polynomial path orders
is significantly increased.

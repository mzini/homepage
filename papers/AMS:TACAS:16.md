In this paper we present [TCT](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/tct) v3.0, the latest version of our fully automated complexity analyser.
TCT implements our framework for automated complexity analysis and 
focuses on extensibility and automation. TCT is open with respect to the 
complexity problem under investigation and the resource metric in question.

It is the most powerful tool in the realm of automated complexity analysis 
of term rewriting systems. 
Moreover it provides an expressive problem independent strategy language 
that facilitates proof search.

We give insights about design choices, the implementation of the framework and 
report different case studies where we have applied TCT successfully.

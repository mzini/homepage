We propose a new order-theoretic characterisation of the 
class of polytime computable functions. 
To this avail we define the *small polynomial path order*
(sPOP\* for short).
This termination order entails a new syntactic method to analyse
the innermost runtime complexity of term rewrite systems fully
automatically: for any rewrite system compatible with sPOP\*
that employs recursion upto depth *d*, the (innermost) runtime complexity 
is polynomially bounded of degree *d*. This bound is tight.
